# Pupil Detection

This code basically uses Haar Cascades and thresholding to find the pupils in a face and then tracks the pupil on the face. This can be used as an effective measure for lie detection as many of the researches have shown that the when a person lies, there is a tendency to move his/her eyes around and hence if there is a lot of deviation in the centre of the eye then that person can be lying.
